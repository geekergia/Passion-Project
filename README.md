# Welcome to my Passion Project

Hello, I'm Gia. I'm super new to this programming world. I know 5 languages. No, I'm not referring to programming languages, unfortunately. I am familiar with Markup (*yawn*) but new to Javascript, Java and pHp. If using Tumblr ever taught me anything, it would be to become a Web Developer one day. 

This project was never an "assigment". I made it for my own personal use, to see if I would really enjoy programming and also to create something that I could proudly say was my creation.
